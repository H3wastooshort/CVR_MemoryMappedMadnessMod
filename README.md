cursed CVR mod

still WIP, horrible docs, pls do not use!

## how to use (pls don't)
1. compile mod DLL file
2. start CVR with mod installed
3. start one of the datapusher scripts like below
### mice for hands
Install the WinUSB driver for the mice you want to use using Zadig (mice will not work on your desktop anymore. be warned), then start the script and select them from the list using the number.
### arduino pots
upload the sketch to an arduino and attach pots between GND and 5V with the wiper to all analog inputs (only one per pot of course).
start the python script with the serial port as the first parameter (COM4 for example)
###slimevr
enable VRChat OSC in the server settings
